Create a program called MortgageCalculator. Out of 44 pts

It has a Class LoanAccount that has the following fields: 12 pts
public double loanAmount; - required
public double interestRate; - required
public double term; //term is in months required
public double homeValue; required
public double monthlyPayment;
public double totalInterest;

along with a Overidden toString() method that shows all fields  5 pts

the class also has a function calculateLoan() which calculates the following 
calcInterest = interestRate / (12 * 100).  5pts

The monthlyPayment = loanAmount * (calcInterest / (1-(Math.pow(1 + calcInterest, -this.term))))   3pts

homeValue = loanAmount * 1.25
totalInterest = loanAmount * interestRate * (term / 12)

There will be three buttons on the form, along with a form field for each other field. Calculate, Submit to DB and Exit. 3pts

When pressing the Calculate button, all the data will be validated and sent to a LoanAccount object and from there the calculateLoan() function is called on that object.
If all is successful store the result in an arraylist of <LoanAccount> objects and output the HomeValue and MonthlyPayment into the corresponding text boxes. 10pts

Submit to DB will insert all the existing records from the arraylist and put them into the db and clear the arraylist.  5 pts

The Exit button will exit the program. 1 pt

The form will take customerID (doesn't matter what it is, we won't insert it into the database, but use it as a field for database loading and updating). It will also take Loan Amount, Term (as years) and Interest Rate and submit these into an instance of the LoanAccount class.

The monthlypayment textbox and homevalue textboxes will start out as read only (not editable) and will be populated when the calculate button is clicked. 


Along with it create a database called loanaccounts to match the class you created. 
Create a table loans with the following fields:

id - int PRIMARY KEY    10pts
loanamount - DECIMAL
interestrate - DECIMAL
term - INT
homevalue - DECIMAL
monthlypayment - DECIMAL
totalinterest - DECIMAL
datesubitted - TIMESTAMP DEFAULT - CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

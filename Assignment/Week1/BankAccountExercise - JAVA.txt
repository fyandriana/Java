#Bank Account Exercise
#Create a program loop that asks the user if they want to continue.
#If they do, ask them what kind of transaction, deposit or withdrawal
#Otherwise thank the user and end the program.
#They must first deposit money to withdrawal because there
#is no money in the bank. If they try to withdrawal and
#they have insufficient funds, tell them and restart
#only allow amounts > 0 to be withdrawn.
#only allow Y or N as input for continuing the program, if they give the wrong
#input, tell them and ask again.
#Ask for Deposit (D), Withdrawal (W) or Balance(B)

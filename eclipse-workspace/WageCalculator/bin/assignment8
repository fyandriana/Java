Create a GUI application called WageCalculator that will manage an array list of Employees.   Out of a total of 39 pts

Create an Abstract Class Employee with the following fields: 3pts
public double grossPay
public double taxes
public double netpay

Create an interface called Payroll that requires the creation of a function called generatePayroll();  3pts

Create a concrete class HourlyEmployee that extends Employee and implements Payroll with the following fields:   3pts
public String name
public double hourlyWage
public double hoursWorked

Create a constructor that takes, name, wage and hours   3pts

set up toString method to output all data. 3pts

set up generatePayroll to calculate based on 3 pts
grossPay = wage*hours
taxes = grossPay * 0.15
netpay = grossPay - taxes

Create a concrete class SalaryEmployee that extends Employee and implements Payroll with the following fields:   2pts
public String name
public double salary

Create a constructor that takes, name and salary  3pts

set up toString method to output all data.   3pts

set up generatePayroll to calculate based on   3pts
weeklysalary = salary / 26
grossPay = weeklysalary 
taxes = weekysalary * 0.15
netpay = grosspay - taxes

On the form, the employee type will be select from a drop down list (Hourly or Wage) disable all buttons and fields until an employee type is selected.

Clicking submit will validate the form, set up a default value called "select" for the drop down list, if this value is chosen (meaning they didnt make a proper selection) then don't allow them to proceed (invalid). Validate all fields for emptyness and the wage and hours boxes as numbers. If valid submit the Employee to the correct object type and display their toString in the textarea txtOutput. Also submit them to the array list of <Employee>. (points in validation section)

There is also a Show Report button at the bottom underneath the txtOutput, when clicked will output all the toStrings of the arraylist to txtOutput
